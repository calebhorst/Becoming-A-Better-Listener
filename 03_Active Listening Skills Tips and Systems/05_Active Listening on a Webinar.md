## Active Listening on a Webinar
```
By this point, you probably feel like these tips are things that we've talked about five different times during this course, and that's true. A lot of the tactics that we're going to use to improve our active listening skills are similar across the board. What I want to do is share in different scenarios very specific tactics, special to that scenario. Webinars are similar to phone calls. But there are differences. The first is, just like I said earlier, turn off your email and don't surf the web. I know it's really tempting, especially because you're already on your computer. It would be really easy to mute yourself and go about your normal business. But if that's the case, don't even get on the webinar in the first place. Something that can help keep you engaged is to ask relevant questions to the person who is presenting. Usually you can do this in a chat or a questions box in the webinar software. I encourage you, though, if you do that to keep the questions or suggestions relevant, it's distracting as a presenter, when I see the questions box fill up with things that are really just not relevant. I want interesting dialogue and I want interesting questions. I don't want a lot of garbage there. So, if you have anything relevant to add, then go ahead and add it. Otherwise, wait until you can figure out something that's relevant to add. As I mentioned earlier, take notes with the mindset that you're going to prepare to give a presentation to somebody else. Also, write down what your reactions and thoughts were to the information that you saw. Specifically, I'm talking about your emotions. Did you agree with what the presenter was talking about? Do you feel like there were things that were left unanswered? When you go through this writing exercise, you're going to think about the ideas presented in a different way. Debrief. What are the things that you learned from the presentation? Having learned this stuff, are you going to do anything differently? You can even write down if you were the presenter, what else you would have included or what you would have excluded.

## Notes
Webinars are a unique format of online presentations that require active listening and engagement. To make the most of webinars and improve your active listening skills during these virtual sessions, consider the following specific tactics:

1. **Minimize Distractions:**
   - Just like with phone calls, eliminate distractions during webinars. Close email, browser tabs, and any other applications that might divert your attention.

2. **Ask Relevant Questions:**
   - If the webinar provides a chat or questions feature, use it to ask relevant and insightful questions. This not only helps you engage with the content but also contributes to a more dynamic and interactive session.

3. **Note-Taking with the Mindset of Presenting to Others:**
   - Take notes with the intention of presenting the information to someone else. Summarize key points, important takeaways, and any interesting findings. These notes can later serve as a resource for your own understanding and for sharing with colleagues.

4. **Document Your Reactions and Thoughts:**
   - While taking notes, include your reactions and thoughts about the information presented. This can include your agreement or disagreement with the content, unanswered questions, or areas of particular interest. Documenting your emotional responses can deepen your understanding of the material.

5. **Debrief After the Webinar:**
   - After the webinar concludes, take time to debrief. Reflect on what you've learned, how the information might impact your work or decisions, and any changes you intend to make based on the content. Consider what additional topics or points you would have included if you were the presenter.

By applying these tactics, you can enhance your active listening skills during webinars, stay engaged with the content, and gain a deeper understanding of the topics presented. Webinars offer valuable opportunities for learning and professional development, so making the most of them through active listening is essential.

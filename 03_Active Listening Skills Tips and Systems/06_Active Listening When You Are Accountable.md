## Active Listening at a Restaurant
```
I wanted to throw the restaurant scenario in this list of scenarios, because at a restaurant there's a lot of things that we don't control. We're not in our office. We're not in a conference room. We're not on a phone call. We're in a restaurant that has a lot of other people and possibly a lot of distractions. The tactics in this video might be similar to what you implement when you go to a conference with a lot of people. Here's some specific things that you can do. First. If you have attention issues, try and face the wall or something else that's not going to distract you. There's nothing wrong with having attention issues, but if you have them, realize that and put yourself in a situation where you're not taking yourself out of the conversation just because of where you're sitting. If you don't have these issues, then position your guests so that they're facing the wall. Hopefully, they're not going to be facing a TV. You want to give them a rather boring background so that they focus more on you rather than having their eyes wander and become distracted. As we mentioned earlier, you want to take notes of the most important things and your follow up items. Do this in such a way that you still look very engaged in the conversation. You're not writing down everything they're saying, you're just taking notes of the most important things. I would encourage you to stay off your phone. Now you might take your notes on your phone, or you might have a very important phone call that's coming in that you couldn't reschedule. That's okay. I would just suggest that you just tell the other people that that's what you're doing. I've gone to a number of lunches where I have said, "Just so you know, I have an important phone call that I'm expecting. I need to take it, but I'll be very, very quick." Typically in a restaurant meeting. People aren't taking notes. So what I would do is send a follow up email summarizing the main points and then any follow up from anybody in the meeting. I think everybody would appreciate that gesture

## Notes
Dining in a restaurant can present unique challenges for maintaining active listening and engagement during a conversation. Here are specific tactics you can implement to ensure effective communication in a restaurant setting:

1. **Choose Your Seating Wisely:**
   - If you have attention issues, try to select a seat that faces a less distracting direction. Facing a wall or a quiet area can help minimize external distractions. On the other hand, if you don't have such issues, position your guests so that they are not facing distracting elements in the restaurant, such as TVs or a bustling kitchen. This encourages better focus on the conversation.

2. **Take Purposeful Notes:**
   - Carry a small notebook or use your phone to jot down key points and follow-up items. The goal is to capture the most important information without appearing disengaged. Make sure your note-taking doesn't overshadow the conversation. It should be subtle and non-disruptive.

3. **Minimize Smartphone Usage:**
   - While you may use your phone for note-taking or if you have an urgent call, inform your dining companions beforehand. Let them know the situation and that you'll be as brief as possible. This level of transparency helps maintain respect for the ongoing conversation.

4. **Send a Follow-Up Email:**
   - Since taking notes might not be a common practice during restaurant meetings, consider sending a follow-up email to summarize the main points discussed and outline any follow-up actions or assignments. This gesture is appreciated by all participants and ensures clarity and accountability.

5. **Engage Actively:**
   - Maintain eye contact, nod, and use body language to demonstrate your active engagement in the conversation. While the restaurant setting may offer more distractions, your active participation helps anchor the focus on the discussion.

Restaurants can be lively and distracting environments, but by applying these tactics, you can better control your surroundings and ensure effective communication during your dining experiences.

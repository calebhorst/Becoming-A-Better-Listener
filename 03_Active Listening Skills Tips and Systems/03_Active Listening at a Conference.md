## Active Listening at a Conference
```
In these next five videos. What I want to do is share specific tactics during different situations. So a lot of the stuff that we've talked about up until this point would apply in many of these situations. But in these specific situations, what are the special tactics that we want to pay a lot of attention to? In the green, on each of the five different scenarios, I asked the question, What is the goal? Because maybe at a conference, your goal isn't to listen to any of the speakers. Your goal might be networking, developing relationships, helping other people understand who you are, aka, "What's your personal brand?" It might be listening, but it might not. So before you get into any of the situations, I want you to think, "Am I really there just to listen or are there other things I need to do in this particular situation." All right, let's start off with listening at a conference. If my goal was to listen at a conference, maybe just to one particular speaker, here are the specific things that I would do: First, I'm going to go into this with the mindset that I'm going to present this to somebody else. What that means is, I'm going to pay attention in a different way, than just sitting back and looking for inspiration from that speaker. I have to think, What are the main topics? What are the main things that they're talking about? And can I present this at length to somebody else? I'm going to listen differently. If I go in with that mindset, I would definitely take notes. Again, I'm not necessarily going to do this word for word. I might just note what the main topics or ideas are, but I'll definitely take notes so that I don't forget certain things or if they have a very clever phrase or saying or slogan or something like that. I can write that down. I would take my notes at a higher level. This ensures that I get all of the main points and not get stuck on writing perhaps sentences and sentences of something that really doesn't matter. I would try and list anything that I say, "Oh, man, that was really cool." In my notes, I would list anything that really catches me as interesting. It might not even be something the speaker says, or even intends to have as a really important topic, but if it impacts me, I'm going to write it down. I would also list any follow up items that would make the whole message more impactful. I would ask other participants. What did they think? What were the main highlights that they got out of the conversation and what are they going to do, having gone to that presentation? Later on, I'm going to have my personal debrief. This is when I go through my notes. I'll take a line and drill down on that. I like the idea of a debrief after the presentation, because then I'm not so stressed on time because then I have more time to go deeper into the ideas and even put some of my own ideas mixed with the speakers ideas. Again, If you're at a conference, it might not be your main goal to go listen to every speaker and get us much as you can out of all the speakers. When I go to a conference, I have certain relationships that I want to make or nurture. That becomes much more important than going to some of the sessions. But if there is a session that you're really looking forward to these are, some ideas to help you get more out of the presentation.

## Notes
Listening at a conference can be a great opportunity to gain valuable insights and knowledge from various speakers and presenters. To maximize your listening experience and make the most out of the sessions, here are specific tactics and considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Set Clear Goals:**
   - Determine your primary goal for attending the conference. Is it to gain insights, network, or something else? Understanding your purpose will guide your approach to each session.

2. **Present to Someone Else:**
   - Approach the sessions with the mindset that you will present the content to someone else. This encourages you to actively listen, identify key topics, and prepare to relay the information effectively.

3. **Take Notes:**
   - Take notes during the presentation, focusing on capturing the main points and key takeaways. Avoid transcribing every word, and concentrate on summarizing the essential information.

4. **Maintain Higher-Level Notes:**
   - Ensure that your notes capture the broader concepts and main themes presented. This approach prevents you from getting bogged down with excessive detail and allows you to grasp the overall message.

5. **Highlight Interesting Insights:**
   - Note any particular statements, ideas, or concepts that resonate with you or stand out as interesting. These highlights can serve as prompts for later discussion or reflection.

6. **List Follow-Up Items:**
   - Identify any action items or follow-up tasks that will enhance the impact of the message or the insights gained from the session.

7. **Engage with Others:**
   - After the presentation, engage in discussions with fellow attendees to gather different perspectives and insights. Learning from their highlights and takeaways can expand your understanding.

8. **Personal Debrief:**
   - Conduct a personal debrief after the conference. This involves revisiting your notes and diving deeper into the concepts and ideas presented. You can also integrate your thoughts and ideas with the speaker's content.

These strategies will help you make the most of your conference experience and ensure that you gain valuable insights from the presentations you attend. Whether your primary goal is networking, gaining knowledge, or a combination of both, approaching each session with a thoughtful strategy will enhance your listening skills and overall conference experience.

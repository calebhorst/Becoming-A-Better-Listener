## 11 Steps to Become a Good Listener
```
The second mini system that I want to share with you about how to become a better listener comes from Caleb Storkey. You can get a free e‑book download from the link at the bottom of your screen. Here are 11 tactics or ideas that Caleb presents to become a better listener. First, be attentive. This is inline with going in with the proper mindset. Another way that I've heard this said, is to be present. Being present means leave your technology on the desk and pay attention to the person who's speaking. Next, don't look for something that's more interesting. You see this a lot at networking events. People might be looking over the other person's shoulder, almost like they're looking for somebody better to talk to. They might have good intentions, but it's sending a bad message. Next, don't check your phone in the middle of the conversation. Once again, you might have a great reason to do this, but it sends a bad message. Caleb says, don't just focus on getting your own words in. We've talked about this during the course already. If you're just focusing on what your next part is going to be. You're probably not going to listen to or pay attention to everything they're telling you. Caleb says to use positive body language, make sure that your body language is saying I'm interested. I'm present. I'm paying attention. Caleb says don't hurry the other person. Instead, ask them good questions. If you're really interested in what they're talking about, drill down into that topic a little more. Caleb continues that we should go into a conversation without any preconceived ideas. Of course, we all have prejudice. We're all going to walk into a conversation with certain ideas, but it helps if we can check those ideas. Are they rational? Are they realistic? If we go into a conversation thinking that all they want to do is win or take or something along those lines and we're going to lose, we're setting ourselves up for a contentious conversation. Maybe they're coming into the conversation, and they've already checked their prejudice at the door. Caleb says that we should care about the person or at least care about what they're talking about. We should find areas of agreement. Caleb says that good listeners remember and follow up on conversations wherever possible. Doesn't that also show our respect for the other person and interest in what they talked about. Finally, Caleb says, make sure that you respect confidentiality. Nothing will lose the trust of you faster than the other person knowing that what they shared with you in confidence has now been shared around the entire company.

## Active Listening on a Phone Call
```
Here's specific tactics to work on to have better listening skills when you're on a phone call. Again, remember, what is the main goal here? You might have a role where you really need to pay attention to everything that's being said. If that's the case, check out these tactics. First, we already talked about removing distractions, but when you're on a phone call, let me encourage you, even beg you, turn off your email and don't surf the web. I've been in the room when people are on important phone calls. I've watched them throw away trash, deâ€‘junk their drawers, go through their email, surf the web, all kinds of distractions. If this is important, respect the other person by turning off your distractions. It's been said that when you're on a phone call, if you smile, people can tell that you're smiling. Well, let me suggest that if you're distracted with the internet or your email, people are going to know that you're distracted. Another tactic for a phone conversation is to write out the names of people who are on the phone call and actually use the names when you can during the call. Of course, on a phone call, you don't have the luxury of looking at other people and seeing body language and engaging with eye contact. But when you use other people's names, it's kind of a little wake up call. And it shows that you really care about that person. Again, on an important phone call. You're going to take notes and you should ask for clarification during the call. Take advantage of a few times during the phone call to say, "Let me make sure I understand this correctly." A benefit to that is when they hear you explain what they're trying to explain, they might realize that they communicated poorly in the first place. Before the end of the call, summarize. Tell them what the main points were so that you're all on the same page. Also, clarify all expectations. Make sure everybody knows what their action items are. After the phone call, I would send an email with a similar summary and clarification of expectations

## Notes
Phone calls, whether they are for business or personal matters, can be more productive and effective when you implement specific listening tactics. Here are some key strategies to improve your listening skills during phone conversations:

1. **Eliminate Distractions:**
   - Turn off email notifications and avoid multitasking while on the call. Give your full attention to the conversation.

2. **Engage with a Smile:**
   - Even though the other person can't see you, your tone of voice can convey your emotions. Maintain a positive attitude and smile when appropriate to create a more engaging and friendly conversation.

3. **Use Names:**
   - Make an effort to use the names of the individuals on the call. Addressing them by name can help establish a more personal connection.

4. **Take Notes:**
   - Keep a notepad or electronic device ready to take notes during the call. Jot down key points, action items, or any details that are important for future reference.

5. **Ask for Clarification:**
   - Don't hesitate to seek clarification when needed. If something is unclear, politely ask for more information or an explanation. This shows that you are actively listening and trying to understand.

6. **Summarize Main Points:**
   - Before concluding the call, summarize the main points discussed. This helps ensure that both parties are on the same page and have a clear understanding of the conversation's key takeaways.

7. **Clarify Expectations:**
   - Discuss and clarify expectations, responsibilities, and action items. Make sure everyone knows what they need to do next.

8. **Follow-Up Email:**
   - After the call, send an email that recaps the discussion, highlights key points, and outlines any agreements or expectations discussed during the call. This serves as a written record of the conversation and helps prevent miscommunications.

By implementing these tactics, you can enhance your listening skills during phone calls, promote effective communication, and build stronger relationships with the people you interact with over the phone.

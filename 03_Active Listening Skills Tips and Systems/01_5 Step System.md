## 5 Step System
```
When I was preparing for this course, I came across a number of helpful YouTube videos and articles. Here's a video I found really interesting. Gabby Wallace has a system or a program to help you understand when someone's talking in a language that's not your foreign tongue. This isn't, of course, about understanding foreign languages, but sometimes when we're listening to people, it seems like they're talking in a foreign language. I thought these five steps were so interesting, I wanted to include them here because they might help you become a better listener. Even if it's listening to something that's in your native tongue. The first thing she says is to make sure that you have a proper mindset. A lot of times you'll go into a meeting thinking, I don't know. I'm not a finance guy. I'm not really going to understand all the stuff they're going to talk about or I don't know about all this strategy stuff. I really want to go back to my desk and implement some cool code. I have no idea what this vision and strategy and all the financials and all that stuff is about. If we go into the meeting with those ideas we're kind of going in with a losing mindset. The next thing Gabby says is to listen, read and speak in that foreign language. Now again, I'm not talking about you learning a foreign language, but if you need to understand what your customers or bosses or other people are going to talk about with you, perhaps you need to read some of the stuff that they're reading. Listen to some of the audio that they're listening to and talk with them over lunch and see if you can kind of get familiar with the language that they're using. Gabby's third idea is diversity. Listen to a diverse set of materials. Don't just read or listen to finance stuff, but study accounting, AP, AR, things that are tangential to the main topic. Additionally, listen to and read stuff of different lengths. Maybe you'll read a short article to get some main ideas about the topic, and then you'll switch over to something much longer. I would suggest that you talk to your customers and the people that you're working with in these meetings, where you need to come up to speed and ask them for advice on websites, blogs, audio, books, anything that you could get your hands on to come up to speed on the topics. Gabby says that when you're listening to a foreign language, sometimes what you need to do is simply guess what the person is or is going to talk about. You could look at the situation that you're in, the materials, the PowerPoints, all of those things to get an idea of what they're talking about. If you have no idea what they're talking about, try and take things from the environment and figure out what the main topics are. I know I've been in meetings where what people are talking about is completely over my head. But as the meeting goes on and I have a proper mindset. I'm patient with myself. I can start to put things together and understand better what's happening. Gabby's next suggestion is to understand the big things. Don't worry if you don't understand every minute thing. Now, if you're a programmer, you need to and you want to understand every minute thing. But that might be for another meeting. It can be really easy to get hung up on little things, accents, etcetera, but try and focus on the big ideas, and then, those little ideas can see start to make sense.

## Notes
Gabby Wallace's five steps for understanding when someone is speaking in a foreign language offer valuable insights for improving listening skills, even in situations where the language is not a foreign tongue. Here's a summary of these steps, which can help you become a better listener:

1. **Adopt the Right Mindset:**
   - Entering a conversation or meeting with a positive and open mindset is crucial. Avoid preemptive self-doubt or negative assumptions about your ability to understand the topic. 

2. **Immerse Yourself:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the language used by the speakers. This doesn't necessarily mean learning a foreign language but rather consuming content, materials, or discussions related to the topic or subject matter to better understand it.

3. **Diversify Your Sources:**
   - Don't limit yourself to a single source or type of content. Explore a variety of materials, such as articles, books, podcasts, and conversations that are relevant to the topic.

4. **Make Educated Guesses:**
   - Use contextual cues to guess the subject matter when faced with unfamiliar terminology or jargon. Examine the situation, materials, and visual aids like slides or presentations to piece together the main ideas.

5. **Focus on the Essentials:**
   - Don't obsess over every detail; concentrate on understanding the main concepts and overarching themes. Prioritize the most significant aspects of the topic at hand.

These steps are versatile and can be applied to various situations, enhancing your comprehension and active listening skills, even when the topic might initially seem foreign or challenging. Developing a proactive approach to understanding unfamiliar subjects will make you a more effective listener and communicator in any context.

## Help Focus on Your Message
```
When you need somebody to listen to you ask yourself, Are you the distraction? For example, what are you wearing? Is it appropriate for that setting? Without going into all the faux pas of fashion, like whether something is a good fit on you or they're the right colors for you? Let's just start with the basic question of, for this particular meeting or conversation or presentation, are your clothes making a statement louder than what's coming out of your mouth? Also, how's your language? Some people think that strong language is appropriate. Other people think that strong language is a deal killer. In general, I would suggest that you tone down strong language. Maybe you can adjust that after you get to know the person and learn about their thresholds of offence. But even then, I've seen conversations and sometimes relationships impacted when people use inappropriate language. Along those lines, are you offensive? I remember a board meeting I went to. Before the meeting started, there was an inappropriate joke. It didn't have strong language, but it was offensive and that stayed with me during the entire meeting. Sometimes we think we're being clever or funny or cute when we use sarcasm or double meanings or maybe even underhanded comments. I ask you if these are obvious, but really don't have the double meanings or the underhanded comments. If you want someone to understand what you're saying, then straight out, tell them what you're saying. Also, are you multitasking? If you allow yourself to become distracted by doing other things other than communicating to the person or group that you're talking with, you might be distracting them from your message. Even if you want to show them something on the computer, what you're showing them might take them away from the conversation. You should ask yourself, "Is this person or group that I'm talking with important to me?" If the answer is yes, minimize the distractions that I list on this slide.

## Notes
Minimizing distractions and ensuring that you're not the distraction is crucial for effective communication and getting others to listen to you. Here are some key considerations to help you avoid being a distraction:

1. **Appropriate Attire:**
   - Dress appropriately for the setting. Your clothing should not draw unnecessary attention or make a statement that distracts from the conversation. It's essential to choose attire that fits the context and doesn't overshadow your message.

2. **Language and Communication:**
   - Be mindful of your language. Avoid strong or offensive language that might be inappropriate or offensive to your audience. Different people have varying thresholds for what is considered offensive, so it's generally safer to use clear, respectful, and professional language.

3. **Offensiveness and Humor:**
   - Avoid offensive comments, jokes, or sarcasm that could offend or alienate your audience. It's essential to maintain a respectful and inclusive tone in your communication. What might seem like humor to you could be offensive or misunderstood by others.

4. **Avoid Multitasking:**
   - When you're in a conversation or presentation, focus on the interaction and avoid multitasking. Engage actively with the people you're communicating with, whether it's a one-on-one conversation or a group meeting. Multitasking can signal disinterest and detract from your message.

5. **Prioritize the Audience:**
   - Consider the importance of the person or group you're speaking to. If they are significant to you or your goals, take extra care to minimize distractions and ensure that your communication is clear and effective. Make them feel valued and respected.

In summary, self-awareness and a conscious effort to minimize potential distractions caused by your attire, language, or behavior are essential to make your message more impactful and encourage others to listen to you. Creating an environment where your audience feels respected and valued enhances the chances of effective communication.

## Help the Depth of Understanding
```
When you talk with somebody, there are certain things that you can do to help them better understand what you're talking about. For example, remove jargon. In certain situations, like in a government job or a large organization or with the military, jargon is a way of life. A lot of times the jargon becomes so ingrained in who we are and how we think, that we communicate to other people using that jargon, assuming they know what we're talking about, I would suggest that we try and identify what jargon is and remove it from our conversations unless we're in the right audience. That means if our audience understands what the jargon is, sure use the jargon. But if there are people there who don't understand what the jargon is, I would say completely remove it. The next one is to remove cliché, and note, I didn't put unless you're in the right audience, cliché should always be removed. Cliché is when we say something that really doesn't have any meaning because it's overused or misunderstood. For example, if I were to say that I'm a team player, that might not mean anything to anybody, especially if somebody says we really need a team player on this team. Well, of course, everybody is going to say they're a team player. That phrase just became cliché and meaningless. Here's the exception, and I talk about this in the LinledIn Profile Optimization course on Pluralsight. If you really are a team player, what you do is you include a mini story or some kind of substantiation behind the claim that you're a team player. In other words, don't just say I'm a team player. Say something like I'm a team player, for example, and then launch into a mini story that shows that you really are a team player. We talked about this in the last video, but it needs to be reiterated. Remove anything offensive. I don't want to offend, so that unless doesn't apply to me, I would suggest that you remove any of your offensive stuff. If you don't, the most memorable part about you or your presentation might be the offensive stuff, not the stuff you wanted them to walk away with. Along those lines, be really careful with jokes and sarcasm. I was at a presentation, once where I tried a joke out. Well, it didn't go very well, but it did set the tone for the rest of my presentation. I had to win the audience back because I bombed it at the very beginning. One of my favorite lines from a movie is from Denzel Washington, he says. "Tell that to me, as if I were a six year old." What he's saying is okay, I don't get the jargon. I don't get the cliché. What you've just said is very sophisticated. Help me understand what you're talking about. We're not talking down to people and treating everybody as if they were six years old or as if they were dumb. But a lot of times we need to change our language so that people understand what we're talking about without getting stuck on vocabulary, scenarios or other things that they don't understand or relate to. Speaking of relating, I suggest you use stories as often as you can. I've heard that when you use stories and connect at an emotional level, there's different parts of the brain that turns on. This will help the listeners remember and retain because of the different parts of the brain that have turned on. Finally, make sure you organize your information logically. Understand what a beginning is. Understand what the content or the body of the message is and understand how you want to close that conversation. Any of these tips should go a long ways to helping other people understand your message, especially if it's a more complex message.

## Notes
To enhance effective communication and help others better understand your message, consider the following key tactics:

1. **Remove Jargon:** Jargon can be confusing and alienating to those who are not familiar with it. Ensure you use clear, everyday language unless you are certain your audience understands the specific jargon being used.

2. **Avoid Clichés:** Clichés can make your message vague and uninteresting. Instead of using clichés, provide specific examples or stories to illustrate your point and add depth to your communication.

3. **Eliminate Offensive Content:** Offensive language or content can overshadow your intended message and leave a negative impression. It's crucial to maintain professionalism and respect in your communication.

4. **Be Mindful of Jokes and Sarcasm:** While humor can be effective in communication, it can also backfire if it is misunderstood or offensive. Use jokes and sarcasm sparingly and ensure they are appropriate for your audience.

5. **Simplify and Clarify:** Consider the principle of "Tell it to me as if I were a six-year-old." This means breaking down complex or technical topics into simpler terms so that everyone can understand. Avoid speaking over people's heads with overly sophisticated language.

6. **Utilize Stories:** Stories engage and resonate with people on an emotional level. They can make your message more relatable and memorable. Incorporate relevant stories or anecdotes to illustrate your points.

7. **Organize Logically:** Structuring your communication in a logical manner helps your audience follow your message more easily. A clear beginning, informative content, and a well-defined conclusion can enhance comprehension and retention.

By implementing these tactics, you can ensure your message is more accessible, engaging, and impactful, making it easier for others to understand and connect with what you're communicating.

## Help with the Follow-up
```
The last idea I want to share with you to help other people listen to you and help them retain what you talked about is the follow up. During this course, we've talked a lot about following up after conversations. I've presented that in such a way that you're responsible for the follow up. Sometimes you're going to be in conversations or presentations where the other person should be responsible for the follow up. Even if it's not your role to help the other person follow up, let me share with you some tactics to help them get more out of the conversation. You could ask questions to make sure that they really understood what they were supposed to do. You might ask them to restate in their own words, what those expectations were. If they're not asking you the right questions, help them ask the right questions. When I'm in a presentation and I have a really important message to give, I might say, "Write this down." There's nothing wrong with helping people understand what your main points are. If you have a follow up list, let them see what your follow up list is. This will show them that you're really interested in follow up and making sure that the conversation doesn't die right there. When they see your list, they'll see how important the follow up is to you. If they don't send the summary email that we talked about in one of the previous videos, then you send the summary email. The bottom line is, when you do these things and follow up, you're essentially training them on how to be better at follow up. You're also reiterating what the main points are that you want them to take away.

## Notes
Following up after a conversation is a crucial part of ensuring that the message is understood and retained. Whether you're responsible for the follow-up or it's the other person's role, here are some tactics to help reinforce the key points and improve the understanding of the conversation:

1. **Ask Questions:** Encourage them to ask questions to clarify any doubts or uncertainties. You can ask open-ended questions to prompt them to share their understanding of the conversation.

2. **Restate Expectations:** Request that they restate the main expectations and key takeaways from the conversation in their own words. This demonstrates their comprehension and provides an opportunity for clarification if needed.

3. **Guide Questioning:** If they are not asking the right questions or need further guidance, help them ask the appropriate questions to delve deeper into the topic.

4. **Highlight Main Points:** If you have essential points you want them to remember, explicitly emphasize these and suggest that they note them down.

5. **Share Your Follow-Up List:** If you maintain a follow-up list, consider sharing it with them to demonstrate your commitment to follow through and ensure that important matters are addressed.

6. **Send a Summary Email:** If the other party does not send a summary email, you can take the initiative to send one yourself. This not only documents the key points but also reiterates the main takeaways.

By employing these strategies, you contribute to a culture of effective communication and follow-up. It helps both parties better understand the conversation and facilitates the retention of important information, ensuring that the message doesn't get lost.

## When You Are Present
```
When you're communicating to somebody and you want them to understand you, of course you're physically present, but I want to know if you're mentally present. Here's some questions that I would go through to help make sure that you're really ready to have this conversation. First, are you prepared? Are there certain areas of the topic that you feel you don't understand yet? Make sure that you're mentally prepared so that you can walk into that meeting with confidence. Do you believe in what you're saying? Now sometimes we're going to have to talk about things that we don't completely believe in. In these cases, people might sense that, and they're not going to believe in what you're talking about either. I'm not saying that you have to fraudulently believe in things that you have a hard time believing in. But just realize that if you have a hard time believing in something, it's going to be easy for people to say I'm going to disregard that message because that person obviously doesn't believe in what they're talking about. Along those lines, does your body language conflict with your message and is your tone giving a different message? If your body language or your tone have a different message than your words. You're going to lose your audience. I want to know, as your audience, do I feel that you trust me or that you believe in me or you care about me? A great example of that is if we're talking and you keep looking over my shoulder to see if there's someone else you should talk to. Very quickly, I'm going to start thinking this person really doesn't want to chat with me. Do you seem defensive in your conversations? If you're the person that I have to fight with in order to have a conversation, I'm not going to want to have that conversation with you very often. I'm not really even going to listen to what you're saying because I'm worried about protecting myself. And finally are you even listening to me? I want to know that you care about my input. Make sure that you take a breath and give time to other people so they can share their ideas or feelings or thoughts or input.

## Notes
Being mentally present and engaged in a conversation is vital for effective communication. Here are some key questions to consider in order to ensure your mental presence in a conversation:

1. **Preparation:** Are you mentally prepared for the conversation? Have you taken the time to understand the topic and gather the necessary information to speak with confidence?

2. **Belief in Your Message:** Do you believe in what you're saying? Your genuine belief in your message can significantly impact how others perceive and receive it.

3. **Consistency of Message:** Is your body language and tone consistent with your spoken words? Inconsistencies can lead to confusion or mistrust in the message you're trying to convey.

4. **Demonstrate Trust and Care:** Do you convey trust and care towards your audience? Building a positive and trusting relationship with your listeners is essential for effective communication.

5. **Avoid Defensiveness:** Ensure that your communication style is not defensive. Being open to dialogue and avoiding confrontational or defensive behavior promotes healthy conversations.

6. **Active Listening:** Are you actively listening to the other person? Engage in active listening to show that you value their input and are genuinely interested in what they have to say.

By addressing these aspects, you can improve your mental presence in conversations and enhance your ability to convey your message effectively while also creating a positive and engaging communication environment.

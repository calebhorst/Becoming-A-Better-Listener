## Have the Right Amount of Information
```
When you need someone to listen to you and understand, you need to make sure that you have the right amount of information. In the green, I put too much versus too little versus just right. Well, what is just right? I can't tell you. That's going to be different for you and the scenario and the audience. But you need to try and figure out, am, I giving too much information. Is this going to distract for my real message? Am I giving too little information? Am I assuming too much? Here are some things to think about. Do you assume that the audience has a certain amount of knowledge or understanding of what you're talking about? Sometimes we walk into a situation and think, "Oh, they totally know this stuff. I don't even need to lay a foundation." Instead of assuming, it might be helpful to start off and say, What do you understand about this particular thing? Also, make sure that your introduction or the foundation that you're laying for the rest of the conversation is appropriate and solid. You need to make sure that you're both starting off at the right place. This means that you don't brush over the introduction, but you set up the conversation in such a way that they're ready to absorb your message and listen to what you're talking about. Make sure that you don't allow tangents to take over the conversation. I've been in a number of conversations, meetings, and presentations where we needed to talk about a certain thing, but somebody was running with the tangent and really taking away from the main topic. Figure out how you would handle that before the situation happens. Also, are you letting your nerves or assumptions reduce you? There have been a number of times when I've been in meetings with people who have achieved certain levels of greatness. I walk into that meeting thinking your great and I'm not. You have power and I don't. There's an obvious difference when I walk into a meeting with confidence compared to when I walk in thinking that the other people don't want to hear me. Even if you have to lie to yourself, make sure that you walk into that meeting with a certain level of confidence in yourself and your message. Depending on how the conversation goes or how much time you have left you might have to consider changing what you talk about and reducing some of the points. What are the main critical things? Recently, I was on a phone call where I was presenting a PowerPoint and the time that we had went from 1 hour down to 30 minutes and finally only 20 minutes. I had to make sure that I focused on my main messages, which meant that some of the things in my slides and some of my talking points went away. Be ready to do that. Know what your main messages are. It's better that you get your main messages in now and then reschedule for another call than it is to go over time. Usually, as soon as you hit your time limit, you need to end the meeting or the conversation. You can ask for more time, but be very aware of the body language or the tone of voice because they might reluctantly give it to you, only thinking that they just need to get you off the phone. Let me share an experience that I had when I was working at the FBI. In the evenings after everybody else had gone home, I would walk around the building and make sure that all of the outside doors were closed and locked. One night, I found a door that was not secure. It was locked, but it wasn't staying shut. I wasn't too worried about it. So I sent my boss an email and the next day when I came in to work, we had a little meeting. As she was asking me about the door, and my experience, and what I saw, just to understand what happened the night before. I was telling her about this door and she was nodding her head like, Oh, yeah, I know about this door. It's really not that big of a deal. I was surprised because it was an outside door. Finally, in the heat of the conversation when I felt like she wasn't really understanding what I was saying, I said, Let's go to the door and I'll show you that it doesn't work. She agreed. We got up, walked out of the office and I turned to the left and she turned to the right. She was assuming that I was talking about a completely different door. Obviously, I didn't have the right amount of information to make my message clear.

## Notes
When you want someone to listen and understand your message, it's essential to strike the right balance of information. Here are some considerations for finding that balance:

1. **Avoid Assumptions:** Don't assume that your audience has a certain level of knowledge or understanding about the topic. Instead, gauge their familiarity and adjust your introduction and level of detail accordingly.

2. **Solid Foundation:** Lay a strong foundation for your conversation or presentation. Ensure that your introduction provides context and prepares the audience for the information you're about to share.

3. **Stay on Course:** Be mindful of tangents that can derail the conversation. If a tangent arises, address it succinctly or set it aside for discussion at another time.

4. **Confidence is Key:** Approach the conversation with confidence in your message and your ability to convey it effectively. Confidence can positively impact how your message is received.

5. **Adaptability:** Be prepared to adapt your message based on the available time and the flow of the conversation. Focus on your main points and critical messages, and consider rescheduling for a more in-depth discussion if necessary.

6. **Clearly Define Your Points:** Avoid vague communication. Be explicit and clear in articulating your main messages to ensure your audience understands the key takeaways.

7. **Eliminate Misunderstandings:** If you sense that your message is not coming across as intended, be ready to take action to clarify. Sometimes, a practical demonstration or visual aid can help convey your point more effectively.

8. **Physical Context:** Be aware of the physical context of your conversation. In some situations, it might be beneficial to take the conversation to the location or object you're discussing to avoid misunderstandings.

By considering these factors and adjusting your approach to suit the context and audience, you can increase the likelihood that your message is understood and absorbed effectively. Finding the right balance of information is crucial for ensuring effective communication and avoiding misinterpretations.

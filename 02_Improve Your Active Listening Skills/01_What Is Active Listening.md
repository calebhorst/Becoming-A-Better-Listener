## What Is Active Listening?
```
Let's define what active listening is, or at least what does it look like and we will contrast that with a different type of listening. Many times, it's easy to see if someone is engaged in active listening. Check out their body language. Whether that's the body language of one person or everyone in the group. Body language can tell you a lot about whether someone is really listening. Also, eye contact. If you're looking at the other person and you have a certain kind of eye contact, it's going to be clear that you're actually paying attention to what's going on. If you don't have good eye contact or you're avoiding eye contact, you might not be listening. When you're engaged in active listening, you will respond periodically. If someone's talking for 5 or 10 or 20 minutes, you're not silent the entire time. Unless, of course, it's a presentation or something where it's inappropriate for you to respond. Active listeners will ask clarifying questions. Those are questions that might say something like, Do I understand this correctly? They'll also ask relevant questions, questions that kind of drill down on the topic that's being presented and understand deeper or tangential concepts. I don't want to give you the impression that active listening is an overly aggressive act. So I want to include that when you're engaged in active listening, you will show patience. We're going to talk about each of these in future videos. Let's contrast these with a different kind of listening, which is passive listening. Characteristics of a conversation where there's passive listening might include that there are many distractions. For example, there's a TV on that you can't stop looking at or you're checking your email or writing emails or you stay on your smartphone. I don't know if you're taking notes or sharing something on Facebook. All I know is you're not paying attention to me. Have you ever talked to somebody and they keep looking over your shoulder? Maybe this is something that you do, and I'm sure that if you do it, there's a good reason that you do it. You're waiting for somebody to come in the room that you need to talk to. The problem is the message that you're giving when they're talking to you and you continue to look over their shoulder is I don't really care about you. I'd rather be talking with 100 other people. If you're talking with somebody and you keep on asking them to repeat what they're talking about or that last phrase, you're probably not active listening. I've been involved in and seen a number of conversations where people give you periodic responses like mm hmm, but it doesn't sound like they're interested at all. You're not sure if they're even paying attention, even though they are giving you those periodic responses. You might get that feeling based on a combination of their body language and eye contact and the way they say mm hmm. Another sign of passive listening is when their questions aren't relevant. Imagine talking to somebody about something, and they keep asking questions that have nothing to do with what you're talking about. Pretty soon you're going to think that they're not even in this conversation. My last example is talking with someone who is anxious to interrupt. They can't wait to share their part of the conversation, even if it's inappropriate for them to do at that moment,

## Notes
**Active Listening:**

1. **Body Language:** Active listeners exhibit engaged body language. They may lean in, nod in agreement, and use open and receptive postures. Their non-verbal cues show that they are paying attention to the speaker.

2. **Eye Contact:** Active listeners maintain good eye contact with the speaker. Their gaze is focused on the speaker, indicating their attentiveness.

3. **Responding:** Active listeners periodically respond to the speaker. They may provide verbal cues like affirming statements, asking questions, or making comments to show their engagement with the conversation.

4. **Clarifying Questions:** Active listeners ask clarifying questions to ensure they understand the speaker's message correctly. These questions help prevent misunderstandings and demonstrate a genuine interest in comprehension.

5. **Relevant Questions:** They ask relevant questions that delve deeper into the topic being discussed. These questions show a desire to explore and understand the subject matter more comprehensively.

6. **Patience:** Active listening involves patience. Active listeners do not rush the conversation and are willing to give the speaker time to express themselves fully.

**Passive Listening:**

1. **Distractions:** Passive listening often occurs in the presence of distractions. The listener may be engaged with other activities like watching TV, checking emails, or using a smartphone, which diverts their attention from the conversation.

2. **Lack of Eye Contact:** Passive listeners may avoid eye contact with the speaker, instead focusing on distractions or looking elsewhere. This lack of eye contact indicates a lack of engagement.

3. **Asking to Repeat:** If someone frequently asks the speaker to repeat what they said, it suggests they are not actively listening and may have missed portions of the conversation.

4. **Superficial Responses:** Passive listeners may provide periodic responses like "mm hmm" or "yeah," but these responses lack genuine interest and engagement. They may sound disinterested even when acknowledging the speaker.

5. **Irrelevant Questions:** Passive listeners may ask questions that are unrelated to the ongoing conversation, indicating a lack of focus or interest in the topic being discussed.

6. **Anxious to Interrupt:** Passive listeners may be eager to interrupt the speaker and share their own thoughts, even if it's not the appropriate moment to do so. This behavior can disrupt the flow of the conversation.

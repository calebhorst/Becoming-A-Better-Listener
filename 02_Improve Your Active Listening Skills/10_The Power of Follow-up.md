## The Power of Follow-up
```
I think in every course I do for Pluralsight, I talk about follow up. It is so important. When we follow up after a conversation, we show that we were actually interested in the topic that we were talking about. We show that we're committed to working on the project or whatever it was that we were discussing. We also build trust in the relationship. This goes both ways, and following up has an important role in building that trust. When you build that trust, it shows that they can trust you with more. More work, more information, more contacts, more introductions, referrals, whatever. If you follow up and you show your interest and your commitment and you build that relationship, they're going to think, you know what? I can trust Jason with this stuff or this relationship. I'm going to do that. Following up is so powerful. The follow‑up can be as simple as an email. It doesn't even have to be a long email. It could be one sentence. Hey, Jim, thanks for the conversation. I appreciated your ideas. I'll get back with you soon. It could be a comprehensive email where we're actually saying, Hey, Jim, here's what we talked about. A, B, C and D. Here's one other thing that I would like to put on the agenda for the next conversation. Here's what I'm going to do and here's what you might do. I like doing the longer emails because later, when I want to go back and look at our relationship and our conversation history, I get more out of the summary emails than I do out of the one liners that said it was great chatting with you. Your follow‑up might be a phone call or a voicemail. It could be mailing something like a gift or a clipping from a newspaper or a magazine. This is going to show your thoughtfulness. One of the most important follow‑ups, I think, is when you return and report. When I give my kids assignments at home, I want them to come back to me and say, Dad, I did this thing and here's how it went. I think this is a great life skill to teach our kids. It's something that we should do also. I call that closing the loop. I'll go back to somebody and say, Hey, by the way, I just wanted to close the loop on our conversation or on this one topic. Here's one last thing that I wanted to let you know. This isn't getting my last word in, it's just making sure that there aren't any things unsaid that really do need to be said. This month, try following up more with your contacts. I think you'll be amazed at what it does for the relationship and the trust level in the relationship.

## Notes
Following up after a conversation is indeed a powerful practice and plays a crucial role in building and maintaining strong relationships, both personally and professionally. Here are some key takeaways and insights related to the importance of follow-up:

1. **Demonstrating Interest and Commitment:** When you take the time to follow up with someone after a conversation, you demonstrate your genuine interest in the topic or project discussed and your commitment to making progress.

2. **Building Trust:** Consistent follow-up helps build trust in relationships. It shows that you value the other person's input and are willing to continue the conversation or collaboration.

3. **Two-Way Trust:** Trust is reciprocal. When you consistently follow up and show your trustworthiness, it encourages the other person to reciprocate and trust you with more responsibilities, information, contacts, and opportunities.

4. **Diverse Follow-Up Methods:** Follow-up methods can vary, from simple emails to more comprehensive summaries, phone calls, voicemails, and even thoughtful gestures like sending gifts or relevant articles. The choice of follow-up method can depend on the nature of the relationship and the context of the conversation.

5. **Summary Emails:** Longer and more detailed follow-up emails, summarizing the key discussion points and action items, can serve as valuable reference points in the future. These summaries can help both parties recall what was discussed and agreed upon.

6. **Returning and Reporting:** The practice of returning and reporting, or "closing the loop," is essential. It involves revisiting the conversation to provide updates, share progress, and ensure that nothing important remains unsaid. This is not about having the last word but about maintaining transparency and clarity.

7. **Life Skill and Teaching:** Teaching the importance of follow-up as a life skill to children is a valuable lesson. It instills responsibility and accountability, which are vital qualities in personal and professional growth.

8. **Consistency Matters:** Consistency in follow-up is key. Regular communication helps keep the relationship active and relevant. It doesn't mean overloading someone with unnecessary updates but ensuring you maintain a meaningful connection.

9. **Networking and Relationship-Building:** In networking and professional relationships, consistent follow-up can lead to new opportunities, collaborations, and a stronger professional network. It can help you stand out as someone who values and nurtures relationships.

In summary, following up is an essential practice that goes beyond being polite; it's a way to demonstrate your commitment, build trust, and maintain productive and meaningful relationships. Whether it's through simple emails or comprehensive summaries, returning and reporting, or thoughtful gestures, consistent follow-up will have a positive impact on the relationships you value.

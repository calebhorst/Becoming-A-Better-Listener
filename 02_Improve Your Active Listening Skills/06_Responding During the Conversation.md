## Responding During the Conversation
```
Another useful tactic to show you are actively listening in this conversation is to respond appropriately during the conversation. I mentioned earlier that maybe mm hmm is not an appropriate response. However, it really could be as long as it's the right time and it sounds like you're actually interested. If you combine a good mm hmm with eye contact or other body language, it'll show that you're really involved in this conversation. A response could be nodding or shaking your head at the right time. Sometimes what you'll do is mirror their emotions and their body language. Just doing something that they're doing as they do it or right after they do it would be a response that shows that you're actively listening. When you ask questions that clarify what they're talking about. It shows that not only are you paying attention, you're really interested and you want to make sure that you understand what they're talking about. During this conversation, if you ask a question and they respond to your question, you should acknowledge their response. This reminds me of a time I was on a radio interview and the interviewer had about 10 or 12 questions that they felt like they needed to get through. The questions weren't in a very good sequence, and every time I responded to his questions, he would respond with an unengaged mm hmm, and then ask the next question. It was really interesting because I felt like he wasn't paying attention at all. And I kept thinking, Everyone who's listening to this radio show is going to know that he's not in this conversation. He's just really interested in asking the next question. Towards the end of the conversation, you could sum it up and say something like, Let me see if I understand you correctly. Are you saying and then put your own summary of the conversation there. There are actually a number of ways to say that. For example, do you mean to say? Are you saying that? Are you implying? Are you telling him that? Sometimes saying what they said, but in your own words helps both of you understand the right message better

## Notes
Appropriately responding during a conversation is a fundamental aspect of active listening. It not only demonstrates your engagement but also helps maintain the flow of the discussion. Here are some effective ways to respond during a conversation to show active listening:

1. **Verbal Acknowledgment:** Small verbal cues like "mm hmm," "I see," or "go on" can indicate that you're actively listening and encouraging the speaker to continue. The key is to use these cues at the right moments, demonstrating that you are interested and engaged in the conversation.

2. **Nonverbal Responses:** Nodding, head shaking, or other nonverbal cues can signal agreement or disagreement and show that you are mirroring the emotions and body language of the speaker. These cues add depth to your active listening.

3. **Clarifying Questions:** Asking questions to seek clarification or further details about what the speaker is saying is a powerful way to demonstrate your engagement. It shows that you are genuinely interested in understanding their perspective and message.

4. **Acknowledging Responses:** When the speaker answers your questions or provides additional information, it's important to acknowledge their responses. This reinforces the idea that you are actively processing and valuing their input.

5. **Summarizing and Paraphrasing:** Summarizing what the speaker has said in your own words is an effective technique to confirm your understanding and validate their message. Phrases like "Let me see if I understand you correctly" or "Are you saying that..." can help clarify and reiterate key points.

Remember that your responses should be timely and context-appropriate. The goal is to maintain a dynamic and meaningful conversation that fosters understanding and effective communication between you and the speaker. By using these response tactics, you not only demonstrate active listening but also create a more engaging and productive dialogue.

## Pause and Plan
```
Up to this point in this course, I've invited you a number of times to put these things into practice. Well, I want to give you this invitation a little stronger. I want you to identify a situation that you're going to have in the next few days where you can put these tactics into practice. What are the specific tactics that you're going to work on. We probably listed 20 or so tactics that you could do to be a better active listener. Don't do all of them in any particular meeting or conversation, for example, you might remove distractions. You might read the person's body language. You might practice your eye contact, whatever it is, list the specific things that you're going to work on and then put a time on that. I will do these things by this date. Here's some examples. The situation might be a one‑on‑one conversation that you'll be in. Your plan might be, I will work on watching the other person's face and body language in a non‑creepy way. Another situation might be an information meeting where you're there to gather information as opposed to be very active in the conversation or give information. Your plan might be, I'm going to summarize the main points, list my action items and then teach it to a colleague. I'll repeat what I learned, what the main items were and what I got out of the conversation. Another situation might be your team's weekly planning meeting. A plan might be, I will list who talks, what their main projects are. What were the issues or suggestions that were brought up and what appropriate follow up should be. Whether that's my follow‑up or someone else's follow up, you might have someone in that meeting that takes notes. But I invite you to do something like this just to see how it impacts your ability to retain and understand what was talked about in the meeting. Another scenario might be when you're talking with someone or a group of people, the plan could be, "I will repeat and clarify what they say." Now I know this is going to be weird and uncomfortable, but I invite you to actually and really try this out this week, do this five times. Do you mean to say or are you saying that, or is there anything else that I missed? This can really be a goofy exercise, but I invite you to give this a genuine shot. Another scenario is watching another Pluralsight course where you're gathering information and there's not really any reaction or interaction or even eye contact. Here's what the plan might look like. "I will remove all distractions, which is what, email and browser, even putting your phone away. Take meaningful notes and leave a comment in the discussion box with one or two things I have learned and how that will help. Actually, you can do this right now. Pause the video. Go back to the browser that has a table of contents of this course, on the right‑hand side, you'll see a link that says discussion and then put a meaningful and relevant comment in the discussion box. Not only does that help us as authors understand what you got out of the course, it helps us know what we can do better for next time.

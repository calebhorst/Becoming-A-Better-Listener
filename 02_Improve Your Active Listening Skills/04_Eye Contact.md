## Eye Contact
```
Let's spend a little more time on the topic of eye contact. Of course, eye contact etiquette can differ from one culture to another. You'll know what's best for your culture. The idea is to be aware of and purposeful in how you use eye contact. Having proper eye contact will let the person know that you're involved in the conversation. You're listening to them. You're paying attention to them. You're interested in them. However, you can do it kind of wrong. You don't want to do it in a creepy way. This means that you're not trying to stare right through their eyes and see what's really happening. Sometimes you might need to take a break. Don't stare into their eyes the entire time. Maybe every 5 to 7 seconds, you look away, but of course, you don't want to under do it. You should have eye contact with the person that you're talking with. This is really hard for a lot of people. But don't follow the distractions. Distractions might include other people, or you might be unusually attracted to a certain part of their clothes or their body. Be really careful about what you're looking at. If it's not their face or their eyes. You might be distracted by a TV that's on or by your watch or your phone or something like that. Where you look says a lot about where you're at in the conversation.

## Notes
1. **Cultural Awareness:** Be mindful that eye contact etiquette can vary among cultures. It's essential to be aware of the cultural norms in your particular context. What is considered respectful and appropriate eye contact can differ significantly from one culture to another.

2. **Maintaining Engagement:** The primary purpose of maintaining eye contact is to let the other person know that you are fully engaged in the conversation. It signals your active listening and interest in what they are saying.

3. **Balancing Eye Contact:** Proper eye contact is about balance. While you want to establish and maintain eye contact to convey your attentiveness, it's important not to overdo it. Staring too intensely or for too long can come across as intimidating or creepy. Instead, aim for natural, periodic eye contact throughout the conversation.

4. **Taking Breaks:** You don't need to maintain constant, unbroken eye contact. It's perfectly acceptable to take short breaks during the conversation. Every 5 to 7 seconds is a general guideline for re-establishing eye contact, but this can vary depending on the context and the culture. These brief breaks allow for natural blinking and prevent the conversation from feeling overly intense.

5. **Avoiding Distractions:** It's crucial to maintain your focus on the person you are conversing with. Avoid being distracted by other people, objects, or elements in the environment. Give your full attention to the speaker and avoid distractions that may undermine the quality of the conversation.

6. **Appropriate Gaze:** Be conscious of where your gaze lands. It should primarily focus on the other person's face and, most importantly, their eyes. Avoid staring at specific body parts, clothing, or other objects, as this can be distracting and uncomfortable for the other person.

7. **Conveying Engagement:** Your eye contact should convey your active engagement in the conversation, reflecting your genuine interest in the speaker and their message. Appropriate eye contact contributes to building rapport and trust during the interaction.

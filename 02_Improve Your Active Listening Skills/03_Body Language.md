## Body Language
```
Here are some ideas on how you can get deeper into the conversation and better understanding just by observing the other person's body language. You're going to do this by watching them. What are you looking for? You're looking for their mannerisms. How are they acting? How are they moving? For example, what do they do with their hands? Are their hands in their pockets? Are their fingers crossed? Are their hands moving all over the place? This might help you understand whether they're really bought into the idea or not. Another thing to look for is where are they looking? If they continually look down and they won't maintain eye contact with you? Perhaps they're trying to hide something. Someone that's passionate about body language told me that if they continue to look to the side or up to the side, they're kind of searching for ideas. They really are not sure what their message is or how to say it. Pay attention to where they're looking. Also, are there arms crossed? A lot of people think that crossing your arms could mean that they're closed and they don't want to hear what you're saying. They're not open to any other ideas. I think it'll be obvious when we're looking at somebody that we could see if they're closed to the idea. My body language friend said that you can't take one single indicator and draw a conclusion from that. For example, if I have my arms crossed, it might mean that I'm not interested in what you're talking about. But it might mean that that's just more comfortable for me. So what he says is, what you want to do is take two or three indicators like How are their arms, where they looking and maybe another indicator of their body language, and then try and figure out whether they're open or closed or excited or whatever. Is the person that you're talking to kind of dancing around. If they're moving a lot, maybe they're nervous about something and let's flip this around. What's your body language saying? Maybe what they're doing is simply mimicking your body language, and you're setting the tone for the whole conversation. If you engage them with eye contact, this can help them have better eye contact with you. I say, unless they're lying, feel guilty or ashamed or something like that. But remember, you can't take one indicator and make your conclusion about how they're feeling or where they're at. A lot of this stuff by itself is a generalization. I certainly wouldn't say, "You know what? You're crossing your arms. You obviously don't agree with what I'm talking about." I find that I cross my arms a lot in conversations because it's a more comfortable position for me. When you're trying to engage eye contact with them, don't stare through their eyes. Some people have a way of looking at you that it seems like they're looking right into your soul. You don't want to make people uncomfortable by the way you're looking at them. Also, you don't want to call them out on anything or look at them in a way where they feel like they're being interrogated. Unless, of course, you're interrogating them.

## Notes

1. **Mannerisms and Hand Movements:** Pay attention to what the other person does with their hands. Are they in their pockets, crossed, or moving expressively? Hand movements can provide insights into their level of engagement and enthusiasm for the discussion.

2. **Eye Contact:** Observe where they are looking. Maintaining good eye contact can indicate active listening and engagement. Avoiding eye contact or frequently looking down might suggest discomfort or uncertainty.

3. **Arms Crossed:** While crossed arms are often associated with defensiveness, it's essential not to draw hasty conclusions. Consider multiple body language indicators to gain a more accurate understanding of their stance.

4. **Body Movement:** Observe their overall body movement. Are they fidgeting, shifting, or dancing around? These movements can reflect nervousness or discomfort in the conversation.

5. **Mirroring:** Consider whether the other person is mirroring your body language. If they are mimicking your gestures and maintaining eye contact, it can be a sign of engagement and rapport.

6. **Engaging Eye Contact:** When trying to engage with someone through eye contact, ensure that you do so naturally and without making them uncomfortable. Avoid intense or intimidating stares, especially if it's not appropriate for the context.

7. **Avoid Interrogation:** Be mindful of your gaze and body language to prevent the other person from feeling interrogated. You want to create a comfortable and open environment for the conversation.

It's crucial to remember that individual body language cues should be considered in combination rather than in isolation. One gesture may not tell the whole story, so look for patterns and consider the context of the conversation. Effective body language observation can enhance your understanding and improve your ability to connect with others during conversations.

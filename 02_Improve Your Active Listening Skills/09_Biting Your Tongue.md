## Biting Your Tongue
```
We talked about active listening, including patience. This means that sometimes we're not going to talk. You have to get in the proper mindset and know that you're not in the conversation just to make sure that you're being heard and you get all of your points across. One of the problems that a lot of people have in a conversation is that they're not really listening to understand. Like we talked about in the introduction to this course, they're actually thinking about how they're going to respond. When the other person is talking, if all you're thinking about is how you're going to respond, you're probably not going to listen or understand what they're talking about. And perhaps worse, you might interrupt in an inappropriate way. I would encourage you to practice patience and resist the need to interrupt. This is not a race. It's not about, "We have 10 minutes. I need to make sure that I say all my stuff before they do, or I get all of my points in." Sometimes people do that because they forget they're prone to forgetting thoughts and ideas. So what can you do if you're prone to forget to make sure that you get the important things in the conversation. Well, if you do forget parts of your conversation, which isn't uncommon, you could simply say I don't remember what I was going to say and then go into something else. Or maybe you should write your points down before the conversation so you don't forget or caught up in the emotion or go down a tangent that takes up all of the time. If you interrupt, it's as if you had a big sign saying, "I don't really care what you're talking about. Let me have my turn." However, if you're prepared, maybe writing the points down or thinking through how the conversation could or should go, you'll be able to focus more on what their message is and their body language and respond appropriately, still staying true to the main theme of the conversation or the points that you feel are important to stay in the conversation. You should know what your main objectives are for that conversation. Sometimes I'll go into a conversation with a completely different idea than the other person. They're taking it down a path that I wouldn't choose to go to, and that's when I decide this is not the right time for what I thought the main objectives are. So we're going to have to schedule a different call, and I'll make it more clear what we need to talk about. In a situation like that, I've found that it's sometimes appropriate to let them have their part of the conversation and reschedule, as opposed to interrupting them. Sometimes they just need to get their main points taken care of. Make sure that when you're putting together your objectives and you're talking points, that they're all aligned. If you have an objective and 3 or 4 talking points, and one of those talking points doesn't really have to do with everything else, maybe that's for a different conversation, or it just doesn't need to be said. As we alluded to earlier, responding in your mind and trying to figure out what the right words and the right way to say things and how you want to come across will probably cause you to miss the conversation. You'll be switching from an active listener. Your body language will probably even communicate that you've made that transition away from being an active listener. So what do you do? Be ready to not get all of your points across. Maybe it's not the right timing. You can actually save them for a later conversation, or you can email the points later. Also, recognize that the conversation might have gone a completely different direction, and the points that you wanted to get across are really not as relevant as you thought they would be. Realize that the conversation is not a race, it's not a contest, and it's not about you winning. There's a phrase that I heard in sales that I love. It is, "He who talks first, loses." Let me give you an example. This is a personal example, but I'm sharing it because we see this in many different scenarios. Remember I said that the purpose of listening is not to be heard, and it's not to make sure we get all of our points in. This story is an example of how you can do it wrong, and it's not unusual to hear a conversation like this amongst two adults. A few nights ago, I was talking to my 10‑year‑old daughter. We were talking about something she really wanted. She was getting emotional about this and wanted to make sure that I understood how important this was for her. Well, early on in the conversation, I said, "Okay, you can have it." And that was it. It was no big deal. However, she continued talking and making her case in a very passionate way. It was frustrating to say, Okay, you get what you want, which was obviously a surprise to her. But then she kept talking and talking and talking in a way that was inappropriate, and I took away what I was going to give her. Let me just reiterate this phrase and bring it out in bigger letters because it's such an important phrase. "He who talks first, loses." Sometimes what we communicate when we don't say anything can be more powerful than trying to cram all of those points in that we had written down previously. Write this phrase down. I imagine it will help you in the next year.

## Notes
The advice to practice patience and resist the urge to interrupt is valuable for effective listening. It's important to remember that listening is not just about waiting for your turn to speak but truly understanding the other person's perspective and message. Here are some key takeaways and additional insights related to this aspect of active listening:

1. **Active Listening vs. Waiting to Speak:** Active listening involves fully engaging with the speaker's words, emotions, and intentions. If you're merely waiting for your opportunity to speak, you might miss critical nuances and the speaker's deeper meaning.

2. **Thoughtful Responses:** Instead of formulating your response while the other person is speaking, focus on comprehending their message. This will enable you to provide more thoughtful and relevant responses when it's your turn to speak.

3. **Clarity and Alignment:** Ensure that your objectives and talking points align with the conversation's theme and the other person's objectives. If your points diverge or are not relevant, consider saving them for a different discussion.

4. **Timing Matters:** Recognize when the right timing is for certain points or objectives. Sometimes, letting the other person express their main points without interruption is more effective. You can address your concerns or ideas later in a separate conversation or email.

5. **Emotional Awareness:** Be sensitive to the speaker's emotional state and objectives. If they are highly passionate or emotional about a topic, this might not be the ideal moment to bring up unrelated or less urgent matters.

6. **Respect and Communication:** Interrupting a speaker can come across as disrespectful or dismissive. It can send a message that you prioritize your thoughts over theirs, which can hinder effective communication and collaboration.

7. **Balancing Listening and Speaking:** Effective conversations involve a balance between listening and speaking. When you've practiced patience and truly understood the other person's perspective, it's your turn to respond more effectively and constructively.

The story you shared about your interaction with your 10-year-old daughter is a great example of how "he who talks first, loses." In many conversations, patience and active listening can lead to more productive and respectful exchanges.

Overall, the key to effective communication is being fully present in the conversation, actively listening to understand, and responding thoughtfully rather than impulsively. Practicing these skills can enhance relationships, minimize misunderstandings, and lead to more successful interactions.

## Mindset: Can You Teach Someone Else?
```
In a number of resources I use to gather information about active listening. I found that a lot of authors talk about having the proper mindset, making sure that you go into a conversation with the idea that you're going to have a good conversation and be involved in that conversation. With that in mind, I would like to frame that concept for you in a way that I think will have a big impact on your ability to be involved in the conversation, retain and understand what's being talked about. The idea is that you should go into a conversation thinking I'm here to represent someone else. That means I need to make sure I really understand what's being talked about, and I am able to communicate that effectively back to other people. If you go in with this mindset, you should retain more information, understand the issues in a deeper way, and you will show that you're a better, more engaged listener. Here are too many assignments for you. Give this a try. Take a conversation or even a Pluralsight course that you've had in the last few days and share that conversation with somebody else. If you can't think of another conversation, then take the ideas from this course or a certain video from this course and teach someone what you learned. Can you imagine how much more you'll pay attention if there's accountability after you're done? Here's another idea. Ask someone else who was in a meeting that you were in, what they got out of the meeting. What were the most important things that you need to know. You can flip this idea around and say, Hey, can I get a few minutes of your time? I'd like to share what I think was important out of that meeting and get your feedback to see if there was anything I missed. The whole idea is that before we go into these important conversations and meetings or training environments, we go in with the right mindset and the mindset of I'm going to have to teach someone else this is going to set us up to be a much better listener

## Notes
1. **Share a Conversation:** Take a recent conversation or course you've had and share the information with someone else. This could be summarizing the key points and insights from the conversation or course. By doing so, you create accountability for yourself to retain and communicate the information effectively.

2. **Ask for Feedback:** Ask someone else who was in a meeting or training session with you to share their perspective on what they found most important or valuable. This feedback can help you gain a different viewpoint and ensure you didn't miss any critical points.

3. **Teach Someone:** Take on the role of a teacher and explain what you've learned from a conversation or course to someone else. Teaching requires a deep understanding of the subject matter, which can encourage active listening and comprehension.

The central idea is to prepare for conversations with the mindset that you will need to convey the information effectively to others. This approach can enhance your listening skills, understanding, and retention of information, making you a more engaged and effective listener.

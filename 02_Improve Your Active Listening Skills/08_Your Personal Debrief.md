## Your Personal Debrief
```
Let's take this idea of spending time after the meeting or conversation and writing more in our notes and explore the idea of having a personal debrief. This is when you're going to think about what happened and drill a lot deeper into your notes. This is something I recommend you do in a written or typed manner. A personal debrief might be a summary of the conversation. Can you say in a few sentences or a few short paragraphs what the purpose of the conversation was and what your takeaways were? What did you actually learn from that conversation or meeting? Let's go a little further. What did you think about the conversation and the information? Not just what you learned, but what were your reactions to that? Now that you've had a little bit of time to think about it, how would you have done things differently in the meeting? Would you have responded in a different way and of utmost importance, what do you need to follow up on? The debrief takes the idea from the last video a little bit deeper and maybe in a little different direction. In the last video, we talked about taking your sketchy notes and adding more details to them. In the personal debrief or taking it to the next level, this is where we treat that conversation as an important part of our day or week or month. It becomes a part of our tactics and strategy. We think deeper on what happened and what we need to do from here on.

## Notes
A personal debrief is a powerful technique to reflect on and extract meaningful insights from your conversations, meetings, and interactions. It can help you solidify your understanding, improve your communication, and enhance your problem-solving skills. Here's a breakdown of how to conduct a personal debrief effectively:

1. **Summary of the Conversation:** Start by summarizing the conversation in a few sentences or short paragraphs. Include the main purpose of the conversation and the key takeaways. This step helps you identify the core message and ensures you have a clear understanding of what was discussed.

2. **What You Learned:** Delve deeper into your notes to reflect on what you learned during the conversation. What were the new insights, information, or perspectives gained? This step allows you to consolidate your knowledge and recognize the value of the conversation.

3. **Your Reactions and Thoughts:** Consider your emotional and intellectual responses to the conversation. Were you surprised, excited, concerned, or motivated by what was discussed? Reflect on how the conversation affected your thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. This self-awareness can help you better manage your emotions and reactions in future interactions.

4. **What You Would Do Differently:** Put yourself in a hypothetical scenario where you could redo the conversation. How would you respond differently? What actions or words would you change to enhance the conversation's outcome? This step encourages critical thinking and self-improvement.

5. **Follow-up Actions:** Identify any follow-up actions or tasks that resulted from the conversation. Ensure you document these actions, so you don't forget them. Assign deadlines and priorities to each task to help you stay organized and accountable.

6. **Integration into Your Strategy:** Consider how the conversation fits into your broader objectives, whether they are daily tasks, project goals, or long-term career aspirations. Think about how you can integrate the new knowledge or insights into your strategy and decision-making.

7. **Regular Practice:** Make personal debriefing a regular practice after significant conversations. Over time, you'll develop a valuable habit of learning from each interaction and continually improving your listening and communication skills.

By conducting personal debriefs, you'll not only become a more active and reflective listener but also a more effective communicator. This practice can lead to personal growth, enhanced decision-making, and more productive interactions with others.

## Taking Notes
```
In some situations, it will be appropriate and a good idea to actually take notes. Here's some thoughts on taking notes. First, don't let your note taking become a distraction. Sometimes when I'm talking to somebody and they're taking notes, I'll actually pause until they're done taking notes. I consider myself to be a multitasker, so I'll take notes and have a conversation and listen. But some people can't do that. So what I'll do is if I see you're taking notes, I'll just pause, let you finish your idea, and then I'll continue talking. Even if you say that it's okay to go ahead. I think it's a distraction, and I don't want you to miss the other stuff that I'm going to talk about. If you're going to take notes on technology, whether it's a phone or a tablet or your laptop, be careful of what the message is. Sometimes when I'm talking to somebody and they're taking notes, I wonder if they're on Facebook or doing their email or playing a game. If you take notes on technology, I would simply say, by the way, I'm going to take some notes on my phone. That way they know that if you're on your phone, you're not distracted with something like texting somebody. When you take notes, you should jot down the main points of the conversation. You're usually not going to record word for word what the other person is talking about, but you want to make sure that you get the main points of the conversation written down. Note that sometimes the main points are the other person's main points. Sometimes they're just, "ah ha" moments that you had on your own that the conversation triggered. I wan to emphasize this idea of taking down just the main points, because if you write down everything, you're probably going to miss parts of the conversation. Most people don't write or type as fast as the other person is going to talk. So while you're trying to catch up on an idea from a minute or two ago, you might miss some of the important stuff from right now. Remember the idea from Module One about putting a check box next to the action items. This is a really powerful tactic to not miss important follow up action items you need to do. Another suggestion on taking notes is after the conversation is over, go to a quiet place and drill down on those notes. If there's anything that you put in your notes that wasn't fleshed out enough, then add it at that time. If you're going to refer back to these notes, you're going to be glad that you went back and flushed out the notes as opposed to having something that's just kind of a skeleton with almost the bare minimum. I've gone through my notes before, and sometimes I'll think, What does that mean? Why did I even write that? If I were to have spent a few minutes after the conversation and finished the ideas or thoughts it would have helped me later on.

## Notes
Taking notes during a conversation is an excellent way to enhance your active listening skills and ensure you capture important information for later reference. Here are some key considerations and tips for effective note-taking:

1. **Minimize Distractions:** When taking notes, ensure that your note-taking process does not become a distraction for either you or the speaker. If someone is uncomfortable with your note-taking, you might want to discuss it upfront or modify your approach to minimize disruption.

2. **Choose the Right Tools:** If you prefer to use technology for note-taking, make it clear to the speaker that you are taking notes and not engaging in unrelated activities like checking social media or emails. Transparency is key to maintaining a productive conversation.

3. **Capture Main Points:** While it's impractical to transcribe every word, aim to capture the main points, key takeaways, and any action items that arise during the conversation. These are the elements that will help you remember and apply the information effectively.

4. **Add Context:** Sometimes, it's beneficial to include a brief description or context for the main points you jot down. This extra detail can make your notes more meaningful and informative when you review them later.

5. **Use Symbols and Formatting:** As mentioned in Module One, adding checkboxes next to action items is a valuable technique. You can also use symbols, bullet points, or other formatting to organize your notes in a way that makes them easier to review.

6. **Post-Conversation Review:** After the conversation is over, take some time to review and expand upon your notes. Add any details that might be missing or clarify any points that aren't entirely clear. This post-conversation review can help solidify your understanding and ensure that you have a comprehensive record.

7. **Develop a System:** Create a personal system for note-taking that works for you. It could include using abbreviations, shorthand, or keywords to expedite the process. Developing a consistent system will help you take more efficient and effective notes over time.

8. **Date and Categorize:** Always include the date of the conversation in your notes. If possible, categorize or tag your notes with keywords that make them easy to retrieve when needed in the future.

9. **Respect Privacy:** Be mindful of the privacy and confidentiality of the information you're taking notes on. Ensure that your note-taking is in compliance with any relevant regulations or company policies.

By applying these strategies to your note-taking process, you can become a more effective and organized listener. This will help you retain and apply the information shared during conversations, enhancing your overall communication and problem-solving abilities.

## Objectives of Listening
```
Let's talk about some reasons why we listen. We might listen to gain greater understanding. We might listen to relay compassion. If I'm really listening to you and you recognize that one of the messages that you should be getting from me is, he actually cares about me. He cares about my ideas and my thoughts and me as a person. Contrast that with me looking over your shoulder the entire time or not paying attention at all. And the message I'm giving you is I really would rather be 1000 other places right now than right here. When we listen, we communicate our compassion for the other person. We also listen to read between the lines and get the deeper or real message. We do that by watching body language and trying to listen for things that aren't said. At work, we listen to Know and understand what's really expected of us and our team. If we don't know the expectations or we don't understand the specs of a project we're simply setting ourselves up for failure. At work, we should listen so that we can understand and know what's expected of us and our team. If we don't understand the expectations were simply setting ourselves up for failure. Also, we would listen so that we could be successful on a specific project or in a specific situation. Have you ever been in a meeting with your internal customers and they're communicating how they want the project done or what elements they need in the final deliverable? They're fully expecting us to understand and know what they're talking about. If we walk out of there with too many questions, they're going to wonder if we're really the right person to do the job. When we listen well, we can be more effective in our job. Becoming better listeners means we might even become more important to the company or to our customers. Getting better at listening means that we might become more wanted. In other words, when people have important projects, they need done right. They asked for us because they know that we're going to listen to what their needs are. Becoming better listeners could mean that we become more valued in the organization. We become more effective. If becoming better listeners means that we become more important and wanted and valued and effective. Doesn't it make more sense that we become more secure in who we are and what our role in value is? If we become all of these things, I think we might even have more fun in our job and in our career. Note that I didn't say that one of the objectives of listening is to be heard. If we focus on making others hear us, typically, we might raise our voices or do something with our body language that might seem threatening. We run the risk that others aren't paying attention to what our real message is. Instead, the message they're hearing is, Man, this guy's a jerk or this guy's dangerous or I need to distance myself from this person. He doesn't care about anything except his ego. In this course, we focus on listening because it's the input part of the communication equation. Now you know, listening isn't hearing, and hearing isn't necessarily the goal.

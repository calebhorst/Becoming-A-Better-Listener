## Poor Listening
```
Think about people who have poor listening skills. If somebody is a poor listener, they might get a reputation or a brand that they don't want. Poor listening can be construed as many different things. For example, maybe the person who is not a good listener is always known to misunderstand things, misunderstand intentions, misunderstand specs, misunderstand the purpose of the project or the values of the organization. You don't want to be the person who always misunderstands things because you have poor listening skills. People with poor listening skills are probably known as the people who have low comprehension. For example, if you meet with your customers for a couple hours and they're communicating all kinds of great specs to you and then you come back and you continually ask them, What does this mean? And what does that mean? People might think, "were they even listening?" As we talked about in the last video, the message there might be, I don't really care about you. I'm not listening to you. I'd rather be somewhere else. If you're the poor listener, people think that you just simply don't have any interest in this particular topic. Unfortunately, if they think that you're not able to understand the depth or the scope of the project. They might think that you're not mature enough to have the role that you have. A symptom of that might be when they asked, "Can I talk to your boss or is there anybody else on your team that I can explain this to?" Once again, this is not good for your career. Your inability to listen well might show that you're not ready to have the position that you have. If you have a reputation that you're not good at listening, your company and colleagues might not want to ever put you in front of a customer. That goes back to the stereotype that we're talking about at the beginning of this course. You should be able to think of examples in your life or in the media of situations where there was poor listening. Can you think of any examples of poor listening in politics? All you have to do for these examples is go watch some presidential debates. It's not that hard to find somebody who thinks they're responding to a question, but it's obvious that they didn't get the question or they're really just trying to get their angle in. When political candidates do that, they lose trust. Can you think of any examples of poor listening in the business world, whether it has to do a sales or negotiations or projects? I've seen projects where a customer wants a certain thing. Three months later, the developer gives them what they thought it was, and it's really completely different than what the customer asked for. Now, I understand there are many variables that go into that specific scenario, but the fault does not always fall on what the customer communicated. If any of you have relationships, whether they're with a spouse or significant other or with children or parents, you know there are many examples, probably even in your own life of poor listening skills. None of us want these, but sometimes we have negative examples with neighbors and even friends. These examples can lead to decades of tension and lost friendships. I recently rewatched the video where Tom Cruise was on Oprah. I think some people call it the Couch episode. This is where Tom Cruise was jumping on the couches. I thought it was interesting that a number of people who posted the video on YouTube, labeled it as Tom Cruise loses his mind. If you go back and watch that 4 to 6 minute clip, you'll see that he's hardly responding appropriately to anything that Oprah says. It's like he's not paying attention at all. I think that's a great example of poor listening skills. He doesn't care about Oprah. He doesn't care about the TV audience or the audience that's in the studio. I'm not sure what he cares about, but I think he lost a lot of respect from people after that interview. These are a few areas where you can pull from examples of poor listening. What about you? Do you have any specific examples where you simply didn't listen well? Well, if you're human, you should have examples and that's okay. That's why we're doing this course together.

## Notes
1. **Reputation and Brand:** Poor listening can lead to a negative reputation or brand that one does not want. It can result in being perceived as someone who constantly misunderstands, lacks comprehension, or has low interest in a particular topic.

2. **Misunderstanding:** Poor listeners may frequently misunderstand information, intentions, project specifications, or the values of an organization. This can create confusion, miscommunication, and a lack of trust.

3. **Low Comprehension:** People with poor listening skills might be seen as lacking the ability to understand the depth or scope of projects. This can lead to doubts about their readiness for their current role or position.

4. **Lack of Interest:** When individuals are poor listeners, it may convey a lack of interest in the subject matter or in the people they are communicating with. This can damage relationships and hinder career progression.

5. **Ineffectiveness:** A reputation for poor listening can deter colleagues and organizations from putting you in front of customers or clients. This reinforces negative stereotypes about communication skills, particularly in technical roles like IT.

6. **Examples of Poor Listening:** The text encourages readers to reflect on examples of poor listening in various contexts, such as politics, business, relationships, and even popular media. It suggests that these examples are easy to find and can serve as valuable lessons in the consequences of not listening effectively.

7. **Self-Reflection:** The text concludes by inviting readers to consider their own experiences of poor listening and acknowledges that everyone may have such examples. It emphasizes the value of improving listening skills through courses like the one being presented.

## An Invitation: Optimize Your Listening NOW
```
I'm going to make an unusual invitation to you. I would like you to practice listening skills right now during this course. Actually, you could do this during any course. I know sometimes when I'm watching a Pluralsight course, I'll have it open on one monitor and I'm working on something else on my other monitor. And I'm not picking up everything that I should be picking up. I'm going to give you some ideas that you can put into place right now and for any Pluralsight course. Here's some questions that you should ask yourself. Are you listening to this course in the background either on another monitor or minimized so you can work on something else? Are you listening just for certain things to jump out at you? It's kind of like how we read articles online today. We'll look for the title and subtitle and skim through a lot of the rest. Here's the big question. Are you multitasking? Let me suggest that you try any of the specific tactics that I'm about to share with you on this course and the next few Pluralsight courses that you watch. Let me know if your comprehension and retention of the topics actually increase. Probably the most important thing is to turn everything off, including your email and your browser. I know this might sound like I'm asking the world of you. This is really unusual to turn all of these things off for one or two hours. But if you're here to learn stuff and you want to improve, whether it's soft skills, programming skills, networking skills, whatever it is, I want you to get the most that you can out of the time that you spend on these courses. If you turn everything else off and focus on this course, I know that when I turn everything else off and focus just on the one thing my retention goes way up. Also, take notes. You can do this with paper and pencil, or really, you can do it on some app on your computer. To be honest with you, I like to take notes as if I were writing myself an email. That way, when I'm done, I can email myself the notes, and I automatically process those notes. I'm really not good at going back to a spiral notebook or paper based notes that I've taken. However, I know this contrast, what I just said up above, turn everything else off. But what I'll do is I'll minimize my email client and just have my note taking email open. What kinds of things you take notes on. I would suggest that you write things down that you actually learned, but also write down what your emotions or what your reactions were to the things that the presenter presented. Sometimes in my notes, you'll see something like, That's a great idea. I want to implement that, or this is pretty stupid. We tend to remember things that are put in front of us when we have an emotional connection with those things. That's why storytelling is such a big deal. I'm simply inviting you to write down the things that you learn and also make note of what the emotions were when you got that information. Remember these are individual tactics. You don't have to do all of these tactics, but I invite you to implement a few tactics for this and the next few courses that you watch. The next one is to summarize each video or each module in your own words. I was studying in a class with a friend of mine who showed me his method for reading books. He typically reads classics and books that are a little deeper than the books that I'm used to reading. He will summarize every single chapter in his own words. This helps him get a great overview of what the book is about. If it's a book that he's read a couple of years ago, he can pick it up, flip through every chapter and read his 1, 2 or 3 sentence summary of that chapter. He can very easily get a good summary of what he learned, what his reactions were, how he felt about it just by reading those summaries. I'm not saying that you have to summarize every single video that you watch today, but I invite you to try to summarize some of them, even if it's just a one or two sentence summary. Once you've written down your emotions and reactions, why not comment on those? Why did something make you feel angry or upset or happy or whatever the emotion was that you got out of that information that you learned? Realize that this is the next step to writing down what your emotions and reactions were. If you come back to your notes in a few weeks and you read that something made you really excited or really sad. But there's no explanation of why it might not make much sense to you. But if you say this made me sad because and then you spend a little more time drilling down on that, I think you're going to understand, comprehend, retain the information better and longer. Also, write down whether you agree or disagree with what the presenters talking about. If you disagree, what are your alternatives or what are your suggestions or proposals? This is a great time to take an idea and really dig down and explore and come up with where you stand on the issue. I definitely encourage you to list out what your follow up is going to be. When I was an IT manager, I reported to the CFO. I loved watching him take notes in meetings. Every time there was something that he had to follow up on, he would make a note of it and then put a check box right next to that note. If you looked through his pages and pages of notes, it was really easy to pick through the things that he was supposed to follow up on. How many times do we go out of a meeting and kind of forget what we were supposed to follow up on? One of the reasons why is because we've never developed a good system to make a note of what we were supposed to follow up on. Instead of having a summary, here are my to do's at the end of my notes, I simply write down my follow up assignments, which are usually given in the middle of the meeting. And I can easily see what those are because they have a little check box next to them. This is one of the coolest and most effective tactics that I've taken away from that early job. Let me invite you to actually and really follow up in the comments or by email. In Pluralsight, on the rightâ€‘hand side, there is a link that says Discussion. If you click on that, you can see other people's comments and add your own comments. Also, most of the authors are pretty accessible. It's not too hard to find our email addresses. My email address is Jason@jibberjobber.com. Feel free to send me an email and say Jason, I saw your course. I thought it was pretty good or Jason I saw your course, it was kind of bad. I wish you would have covered some other things. Here are my questions. When you do this, you become actively engaged in what bloggers call the conversation or the discussion. And trust me, when you get involved in the conversation, even if it's just one on one, you're going to remember that conversation and the content more than if you just read a blog or watch this course. Let me propose that you put a measurable time on how long you're going to try some of these suggestions. For example, you might say I will close my email every time I listen to Pluralsight courses for the next two months. I know that's a big commitment, but I invite you to try it and see if you really do learn more and retain more and get better at the skills that you're trying to improve. Here are a few more suggestions to get more out of Pluralsight courses, conferences or other learning environments. Describe what you learned to somebody else. When you listen with the idea that you're going to teach or train or communicate to somebody else, you're going to listen deeper. When your reputation is on the line. You don't want to be that guy that watched the video but didn't remember or understand any of it. Pretend like you're going to go into a meeting this afternoon and you're going to have to communicate stuff that you learned from today's course to other people. You're going to listen a lot differently than if you didn't have any accountability. Another tactic that you could implement is to write down your objectives. What are you hoping to get out of this course? I imagine that any course that you watch, you have questions that you want the answers to. Write those down before you start the course and listen for the answers during the course. Think about these questions, what do I hope to learn, or what issues will the information in this course help me resolve? The goal of listening to Pluralsight courses or things similar to these courses is not just to spend an hour or two watching or listening to a course. For me, I spend time on Pluralsight courses because I want deeper understanding of the topic. And I want to remember and retain that understanding. Like I mentioned earlier. This is simply an invitation for you to start practicing better listening right now.

## Notes
1. **Active Listening During Online Courses:** The text suggests that active listening skills can be practiced during online courses, like Pluralsight. It highlights common issues such as having the course run in the background while multitasking, and listening only for specific points, similar to skimming through articles.

2. **Minimize Distractions:** To improve comprehension and retention, the text recommends turning off distractions, including email and browsers. This might require temporarily isolating yourself from other tasks to focus on the course content.

3. **Taking Notes:** Note-taking is encouraged, whether using paper and pencil or digital tools. The author shares their preference for taking notes as if writing an email, making it easier to review and process the notes later.

4. **Emotional Engagement:** The text suggests noting your emotional reactions and responses to the course content. Emotional connections can aid in better memory retention, and taking note of why you felt a certain way can deepen understanding.

5. **Agree or Disagree and Follow-up:** Consider whether you agree or disagree with the presenter's content. If you disagree, jot down your alternatives or suggestions. Additionally, write down follow-up actions or to-dos based on the course content.

6. **Summarization:** Summarizing each video or module in your own words can help you consolidate your understanding. It's not necessary to summarize every segment, but it's a useful practice for key concepts.

7. **Discussion and Interaction:** The text encourages participation in course discussions or reaching out to the course author through email. Engaging in conversations related to the content can enhance understanding and retention.

8. **Setting Measurable Goals:** It's recommended to set measurable time-based goals for implementing these listening techniques. For example, committing to closing your email while watching Pluralsight courses for a specified period to test their effectiveness.

9. **Teaching Others:** Approach the content with the mindset that you will have to teach or explain it to someone else. This adds an extra layer of engagement and accountability to your listening.

10. **Define Objectives:** Before starting a course, define your learning objectives and the questions you hope to have answered. This gives your listening a clear purpose and helps you focus on what matters most.

## Why a Course on Listening?
```
You might be wondering why we have a course on how to become a better listener. Actually, I'm guessing that if you've come to this course, you know why you want to become a better listener and you want to improve those skills. But why is this such a big topic? It's an important topic, and it gets a lot of traction in the management and professional skills conversations. I recently saw a sign on Facebook that said, "The biggest communication problem is we do not listen to understand," think about that for a little bit. How many times are you listening to somebody and you're not really thinking about what they're talking about or trying to understand what they're talking about? Of course, we typically try and understand what people are talking about, but too often we listen to reply. I'm sure you've been in a conversation where either you or the person you were talking with wasn't really paying attention to what the other person was saying. You were just thinking about how am I going to reply to this thing or how do I make sure that I get all of my important points in before this conversation is over. Let's go back to the premise of what this sign on, Facebook said. The biggest communication problem is that we are listening to reply. We're not there to really understand what the person is talking about. We just want to make sure we get our side in. That is poor communication. In this course, we're going to improve our communication skills and we're going to do it, focusing on becoming a better listener. Of course, you already know how to listen. Everybody knows how to listen. Here's some reasons why we put together a course on how to become a better listener. Listening is absolutely important. It's key to the success that we can have in our career. Have you ever worked with a colleague who doesn't listen to the customer or the boss or even you? What did you think about how their career was going to go? I'm guessing you didn't have high hopes for their career until they figured out how to listen better. Let's face it, as IT professionals, we don't have the best reputation when it comes to communication. How many times have you heard something like this? That person is an amazing programmer, but we kind of keep him behind closed doors. We throw a few pizzas under the door every once in a while, but we would definitely not put them in front of a customer. Part of that has to do with the stigmas and generalizations of how we communicate, but it also has to do with how we listen. Speaking of communication, in general, listening is a significant part of communication. Sometimes the best communication that we can give to somebody else is that we're listening. We'll talk about that in a little bit. Poor listening is a well documented problem. You don't have to go very far to find examples of mistakes in listening. Listening is a skill, and if it's a skill, then we can improve it. Sure, some people are born with natural abilities to listen, and they don't have to work on this skill very much. But if you don't think you're a good listener, take heart in the idea that this is a skill and we can work on it and become better listeners. As an added benefit, when we learn how to become better listeners and improve our listening skills will be in a position to help others improve their listening skills. Do you feel like sometimes you're not being heard? Some of the skills in this course can help you help others listen to your message better. Let's draw a distinction between listening and hearing. Hearing is the input that we get in our ears. Listening goes beyond that. It's more about comprehension. It's understanding, connecting with the other person. It's the ability to educate and transfer knowledge. Listening really is a significant part of communication. We really do communicate when we listen.

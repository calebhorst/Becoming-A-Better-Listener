## Effective Listening
```
Let's contrast the poor listening to effective listening. If we're known as somebody who has effective or good listening skills, we're probably known as someone who gets it, we might be known as somebody who understands the problem better than anybody else. I worked with a software architect who people respected because they knew that that architect would understand their problem and bring other perspectives and ideas to the table. The architect was essentially brought in as a partner. To get to that point, he had to use his listening skills to understand what the issues were and be able to bring in other things to show the breadth and depth of his understanding. If we have effective listening skills, then people are going to know us as someone who adds value to a problem or a situation. We'll be known as somebody who cares about what's going on. We would also be known as someone who validates the other person, whether it's their position, their recommendations and ideas or their feelings. If we're known for our effective listening skills, we'll be known as someone who is an integral part of the team. Going back to the customer idea, we might even be known as somebody who they want to put in front of the customer. Can you think of some examples of people who have effective listening skills? Let's go back to the presidential debates. There are sometimes when the responses don't make any sense at all. But there are other times when the response goes to the heart of the issue. People watching the response feel like that politician is talking directly to you. They understand your problem. That's an excellent example of somebody who has listened well. An example in the business world is when you're talking to a sales person and not even realizing that they're closing a deal with you, you don't see them as a vendor or an outsider or a sales person or an enemy. You see them as somebody who gets who you are, empathizes with you and wants to help you. That happens because the sales person has great listening skills. Just like we can find some poor examples of listening. We can find effective examples of listening also. This is when we come to our parents with a problem and they drop everything they're doing and make us feel like we're the only person in the world. How do you feel when that happens? That's a great example of effective listening. When we or our friends or neighbors practice effective listening, we feel like we're in a strong relationship or even a partnership. I recently watched a video where the actor, Matt Damon was talking to a reporter. The reporter was asking some questions that were probably designed to get Matt into some hot water or to have the Matt Damon say a certain thing so that they can go back and support an agenda with it. Well, Matt was listening closely to the question and the intention of the question, and he did a masterful job of going right back to the issue and not playing into the hands of the reporter. I share this example because I want you to think about what happens when we don't listen well. Are we listening to words and questions at their face value? That is how they are presented to us? Or are we listening in a way that helps us understand or question the intent of the questions or dialogue? Finally, just like you might have found some negative examples of listening, you probably have positive examples of when you were an effective listener. I know you don't want to brag on yourself, but take some time and think about when you were able to listen really well. That might be when you understood things well, when you were able to communicate what you understood to other people. I'm sure that you have examples of when you were a good listener.
